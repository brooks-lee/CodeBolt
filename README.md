# CodeBolt
Codebolt is an extended work of the project made by our team 'The Divergents' (comprising of 2 members) in the ACM Game Hackers hackathon hosted by IIIT Sri City on Oct 2016. We had won the special mention prize.       Our idea was to develop a web platform to teach the users the basics of computer science, from basic computers to basic programming and data structures. In the hackathon, we developed a few games that taught users the basics of Data structures with the help of music and common daily life examples. We later extended our work and developed a web platform to teach users basic computer system as well as basic programming.
